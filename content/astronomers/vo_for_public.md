Several projects are developing tools and information for school students and the general public. The VO makes it easier to access real astronomical data, not just pretty pictures!

- [EuroVO for education](https://vo-for-education.oats.inaf.it//index_eng.html?fsize=medium) - This European project has developed special versions of professional astronomical tools which are adapted for use by school students, including improved performance on older PCs, and offline use. They have also developed a set of tutorials showing example useage of these tools. The tools and the tutorials can be found here.
- [World Wide Telescope (WWT)](https://www.worldwidetelescope.org/) - WWT is a stunningly beautiful and freely available tool offering immersive views of the sky and multimedia links to interactive descriptions and explanations of millions of celestial objects. WWT helps students visualize and understand our vast cosmos, inspiring learners to explore, to ask questions, and to practice the scientific skills that astronomers use to build our understanding of objects that are literally across the universe..
