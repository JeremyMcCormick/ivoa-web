The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) was formed in June 2002
with a mission to facilitate the international coordination and collaboration
necessary for the development and deployment of the tools, systems and
organizational structures necessary to enable the international utilization of
astronomical archives as an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory.
The IVOA now comprises 19 VO programs from Argentina, Armenia, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan,
Russia, Spain, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States and an
inter-governmental organization (ESA). Membership is open to other national and
international programs according to the IVOA Guidelines for Participation. You
can read more about the IVOA and what we do at <http://www.ivoa.net/pub/info/>.

### What is the VO?

The Virtual Observatory (VO) aims to provide a research environment that will
open up new possibilities for scientific research based on data discovery,
efficient data access, and interoperability. The vision is of global astronomy
archives connected via the VO to form a multiwavelength digital sky that can be
searched, visualized, and analyzed in new and innovative ways. VO projects
worldwide working toward this vision are already providing science capabilities
with new tools and services. This newsletter, aimed at astronomers, highlights
VO tools and technologies for doing astronomy research, recent papers, and
upcoming events.

# IVOA news

BRAVO VO School and Brazilian National Astronomy Meeting. VO activities will be
prominent in Brazil in October with VO presentations at the
[Sociedade Astronômica Brasileira XXXVII Reunião Anual](http://www.sab-astro.org.br/sab37/index.htm),
and the [Brazilian Virtual Observatory VO School](http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/~bravo/school/).
These events, to be held in the week before the October IVOA interoperability
meeting in São Paulo, will highlight VO science, infrastructure and education
and outreach activities. BRAVO has organized the VO School for South American
students and post-docs to learn about and get hands-on experience with VO tools
and services. VO scientists from US, European, and Indian Virtual Observatory
projects have cooperated to make a joint program of tutorials and to help the
participants use VO for their science.

### NASA HEASARC Xamin Catalog & Archive Interface has VO Inside

Virtual Observatory access is now becoming a standard feature of data archives.
NASA’s High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center’s new Xamin
catalog and archive interface has had the VO built into it from the ground up.
Xamin’s use of VO protocols allows Xamin users to query data at MAST, IRSA, CDS
and many other astronomical institutions around the world — not just the
HEASARC. Users can download catalog information and astronomical data using the
cone, table, image and spectrum VO access protocols.

### VOSpec version 6.5 - Photometry now in VOSpec!

The ESA-VO team is pleased to announce the release of VOSpec version 6.5. The
new version accesses early photometry services from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic
Database (NED) and CDS VizieR. Spectra from Simple Spectral Access (SSAP)
services can now be combined with photometric data from VizieR and NED databases
to build combined Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) that fulfil new science
cases. The following videos demonstrate the new capabilities:

### VisIVO Science Gateway

The new product of the VisIVO family is a science gateway aimed at creating a
working environment for analysis and visualization of astrophysical data. This
product offers its services through a web portal that has been deployed in the
SCIentific Gateway Based User Support (SCI-BUS) project, a European Commission
funded project. This project is a web environment in which the scientist can
design pipelines (workflow is the technological object that better implements
the “pipeline” concept), share them, and seamlessly run them on clusters,
service grids or desktop grids. There are several ready-to-use visualization
workflows that allow the scientist to import data and build interactively
customized 3D visualization and movies using VisIVO visualization tool that is
embedded in the gateway.

### TAPHandle: Accessing multiple TAP services from your Browser

TAPHandle is a web application designed to mine multiple Table Access Protocol
(TAP) resources from a simple browser. TAP services provide SQL-like access to
astronomical tables and databases. TAP services accessed by TAPHandle are
presented as one single browsable resource. This tool helps to explore tables by
showing the columns available and enables users to formulate queries without
typing code. A shopping cart service allows the user to download multiple
resources of interest in one archive. The retrieved data files pass through a
dynamic filter that binds data sets to appropriate applications (preview, SAMP
clients) according to their content description and access format. The last
release also enables browsing of huge TAP services such as Vizier.

### Taverna looks at the sky

AstroTaverna is a plugin for the Taverna 2.4 workflow engine that packages VO
web services and existing astronomical tools such as Sesame and STILTS for use
as building blocks to construct workflows. Capabilities include searching the VO
registry for services to query remote catalogue, image and spectral archives,
efficient manipulation and display of table data and metadata, name resolution,
sky coordinate conversions, and more. AstroTaverna is developed within the
Wf4Ever project.

### AppLauncher and SAMP Become Transparent

AppLauncher is the new Jean-Marie Mariotti Center (JMMC) software to
automatically start Simple Application Messaging Protocol (SAMP) applications
'on-demand'. SAMP applications use the SAMP protocol to interoperate and
communicate with one another. With AppLauncher there is now no more need to have
applications running to send them SAMP messages, AppLauncher manages the process
for you. Users will also easily discover tools they do not yet know, through
SAMP or with the provided Application Dock. AppLauncher is freely available on
the JMMC website, and the technical group is eager to receive your feedback and
include any new software in it.

# Some recent papers about VO-enabled science

### Featured Paper

[Multiband Study of Radio Sources of the Rcr Catalogue with Virtual Observatory Tools](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012BaltA..21..371Z)

Zhelenkova, O. P.; Soboleva, N. S.; Majorova, E. K.; Temirova, A. V.

Baltic Astronomy, Vol. 21, p. 371-378

We present early results of our multiband study of the RATAN Cold Revised (RCR)
catalogue obtained from seven cycles of the ``Cold'' survey carried with the
RATAN-600 radio telescope at 7.6 cm in 1980--1999, at the declination of the SS
433 source. We used the 2MASS and LAS UKIDSS infrared surveys, the DSS-II and
SDSS DR7 optical surveys, as well as the USNO-B1 and GSC-II catalogues, the
VLSS, TXS, NVSS, FIRST and GB6 radio surveys to accumulate information about the
sources. For radio sources that have no detectable optical candidate in optical
or infrared catalogues, we additionally looked through images in several bands
from the SDSS, LAS UKIDSS, DPOSS, 2MASS surveys and also used co-added frames in
different bands. We reliably identified 76% of radio sources of the RCR
catalogue. We used the ALADIN and SAOImage DS9 scripting capabilities,
interoperability services of ALADIN and TOPCAT, and also other Virtual
Observatory (VO) tools and resources, such as CASJobs, NED, Vizier, and WSA, for
effective data access, visualization and analysis. Without VO tools it would
have been problematic to perform our study.
