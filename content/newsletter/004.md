The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) was formed in June 2002
with a mission to "facilitate the international coordination and collaboration
necessary for the development and deployment of the tools, systems, and
organizational structures necessary to enable the international utilization of
astronomical archives as an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory."
The IVOA now comprises 17 VO projects from Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Canada,
China, Europe, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia,
Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Membership is open to other
national and international projects according to the IVOA Guidelines for
Participation. You can read more about the IVOA and what we do at
<http://www.ivoa.net/pub/info/>.

### What is the VO?

The Virtual Observatory (VO) aims to provide a research environment that will
open up new possibilities for scientific research based on data discovery,
efficient data access, and interoperability. The vision is of global astronomy
archives connected via the VO to form a multiwavelength digital sky that can be
searched, visualized, and analyzed in new and innovative ways. VO projects
worldwide working toward this vision are already providing science capabilities
with new tools and services. This newsletter, aimed at astronomers, highlights
VO tools and technologies for doing astronomy research, recent papers, and
upcoming events.

# VO applications highlights

### Skyalert.org

{{< side-image image="skyalert.png" >}}

[Skyalert](http://www.skyalert.org) is a web site that gives access to many
streams of astronomical events. Recently active feeds include
[SWIFT](http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/swiftsc.html) and Fermi, the
[Catalina Realtime Transient survey](http://crts.caltech.edu),
[GALEX](http://www.galex.caltech.edu/), microlensing events from MOA, newly
discovered asteroids from the [CSS](http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/css/) survey,
ultra-high energy events from [VERITAS](http://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/), and
others. Skyalert attaches multi-sourced data to an astronomical event: VO data
services (including [SIMBAD](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr) and
[NED](http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/)) are automatically consulted and links to
[Microsoft WorldWide Telescope](http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/),
[SDSS](http://www.sdss.org/), and other external sites are built. Events can
also trigger data mining code. Skyalert provides real-time feeds of breaking
events that can be mashed up with free cloud tools, such as from
[Google](http://feedburner.google.com/) and [Yahoo](http://pipes.yahoo.com/), to
build new feeds. We are looking for new event streams, and for new ways to
utilize feeds.

### VOSED: SED Building and Fitting Tool

{{< side-image image="svo.gif" >}}

VOSED is a tool developed in the framework of the Spanish VO to ease the
generation of Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) by gathering information from
the spectroscopic services available in the VO. These datasets can be
complemented with photometric information from a number of Vizier catalogues as
well as with data provided by the user. The SEDs are provided in VOTable format
and can be uploaded in other VO tools (for instance,
[VOSpec](http://www.sciops.esa.int/index.php?project=ESAVO&page=vospec)) for
further visualisation and analysis.

### The GalMer database -- simulations of galaxies for observers.

{{< side-image image="galmer-f3_sm.gif" >}}

The GalMer database provides interactive web-based access to the results of
TreeSPH simulations of galaxy interactions in pairs, and isolated galaxies of
all morphological types. Value-added tools allow visualisation and analysis of
the results of these numerical simulations; for example, the spectrophometric
modelling code provides the capability to create model images and spectra of
interacting galaxies on the fly. The website implements interaction with
existing VO tools (i.e. [TOPCAT](http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat/),
[Aladin](http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/aladin.gml),
[VOSpec](http://www.sciops.esa.int/index.php?project=ESAVO&page=vospec))
allowing data to be sent to them directly.

### China-VO Skymouse Client

{{< side-image image="china-vo.gif" >}}

SkyMouse client is a tool (Windows) for accessing distributed astronomical
databases. Text highlighted with the mouse in any window is 'captured' and used
as input for a query sent to astronomical database systems worldwide. The
results are integrated into a combined web page for the user. SkyMouse queries
may also be sent via the web page.

### SIMBAD Annotations Service

{{< side-image image="simbad_icon.gif" >}}

Information on astronomical objects in [SIMBAD](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr) can
now be annotated with new information, remarks, and requests for modification.
The new service allows registered users to post short messages that are publicly
visible and linked from SIMBAD object information pages. Annotations are
intended to improve the quality of information in SIMBAD, and to improve the
level of interaction between [CDS](http://cds.u-strasbg.fr) staff and SIMBAD
users. Regular email support is also available via
[question@simbad.u-strasbg.fr](mailto:"question@simbad.u-strasbg.fr").

# Some recent papers about VO-enabled science

### Featured Paper

[A Population of Compact Elliptical Galaxies Detected with the Virtual Observatory.](http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0293) Chilingarian et al. (2009) Science v.326 p.1379

Chilingarian et al. report their discovery of 21 compact elliptical galaxies
with the Virtual Observatory. These galaxies, characterized by small sizes and
high stellar densities, are thought to form through tidal stripping of massive
progenitors. Only a handful of such galaxies were previously known, preventing
understanding of the role played by this mechanism in galaxy evolution. The new
objects were uncovered via data mining using high-resolution images and large
databases, and were followed-up with spectroscopic observations and numerical
simulations. This work shows that all the galaxies exhibit old metal-rich
stellar populations different from those of dwarf elliptical galaxies of similar
masses but similar to those of more massive early-type galaxies, supporting the
tidal stripping scenario.
