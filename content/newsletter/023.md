**The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) was formed in June 2002
with a mission to facilitate the international coordination and collaboration
necessary for the development and deployment of the tools, systems and
organizational structures necessary to enable the international utilization of
astronomical archives as an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory.
The IVOA now comprises 20 VO programs from Argentina, Armenia, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Europe, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy,
Japan, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United
States and an inter-governmental organization (ESA). Membership is open to other
national and international programs according to the
[IVOA Guidelines for Participation](http://ivoa.net/Documents/latest/IVOAParticipation.html).
You can read more about the IVOA and what we do at <http://ivoa.net/about/>.**

### What is the VO?

The Virtual Observatory (VO) aims to provide a research environment that will
open up new possibilities for scientific research based on data discovery,
efficient data access, and interoperability. The vision is of global astronomy
archives connected via the VO to form a multiwavelength digital sky that can be
searched, visualized, and analyzed in new and innovative ways. VO projects
worldwide working toward this vision are already providing science capabilities
with new tools and services. This newsletter, aimed at astronomers, highlights
VO tools and technologies for doing astronomy research, recent papers, and
upcoming events.

### Northern Fall Interoperability Meeting Overview

Janet Evans and Patrick Dowler

The Northern Fall Interop meeting was held Nov 17-19, 2020 via Zoom with 213
registered participants from all around the globe. The meeting organization was
similar to that of our May Interop virtual meeting. We used Zoom as our shared
remote service, and Etherpad for live notes and questions. We kept presentations
to a single thread (no parallel sessions) and saved a good amount of the time
for input and discussion. Sessions were recorded and posted so that if you
missed a session you can go back and view it. Here is the link if you are
interested in session videos:
(<https://www.canfar.net/storage/list/pdowler/ivoa/virtual2020b>). We worked to
schedule sessions with reasonable times during the day for 2 of the 3 sessions a
day in any one time zone.

There was a call put out for community led presentations. The meeting web page
supported abstract submission for presentation consideration. Contributions at
this Interop were 10-12 minutes in length with additional time for Q&A. The
other half of the sessions were led by the IVOA Working Groups (WG) and Interest
Groups (IG) and focused on core topics related to status and discussion of
current technical coordination group efforts. The community presentations were
folded into WG/IG sessions and provided a nice balance between contributed and
core topics.

The Applications (Apps) WG focused on the software used to access VO services
and data with presentations that included MOC 2.0 status, interoperability
development in the AAS WWT, a VOTable topics review, and protocols for handling
file-oriented catalog data. Data Access Layer (DAL) WG sessions focused on
current efforts including DALI, ADQL, ConeSearch, DataLink, and ObsVisSAP. The
audience was updated with the latest status, and attendees were invited to
contribute and get involved. The DataModel (DM) WG sessions provided status of
ongoing efforts including ObsLocTAP, MANGO – a model for Source Data, and the
Measurements, Coordinates, and Transform models progress, along with ProvTAP
feedback from the community. The Grid and Web Services (GWS) WG aims to define
the use of grid technologies and web services within the VO context. The focus
of their sessions were on authorization protocols and applications. In
collaboration with the Theory IG, a session on science platforms was also
hosted. The Registry WG with a focus on discoverability and bibliographical
tracking for VO-compatible data and services, held a session that focused on
upgrading the VO publishing registry. In addition, in a joint session with the
Semantics Working Group, a discussion of the latest vocabularies were presented.
The IVOA addresses a wide range of topics for interoperability that are aimed
toward ease of data use for the astronomy community.

The Closing Plenary and presentation from the TCG chair Pat Dowler, reminded the
audience of the Technical Coordination Group (TCG) and their role in the IVOA.
The TCG is made up of Chairs and Vice-Chairs of working groups, interest groups,
and committees. They are tasked with building consensus in the WG and community,
assure coordination between WG/IG & the Committee for Science Priorities (CSP),
liaison with the IVOA executive committee, and support committee roles in the
IVOA documents and standards process. TCG membership has a 3 year term with a
possible 1 year extension. Members of the astronomical community are welcome to
get involved in the IVOA and to consider a role in the TCG.

Areg Mickaelian, Meline Asryan

[The 7th Byurakan International Summer School (7BISS)](https://www.bao.am//meetings/meetings/SS2020/index.html)
for Young Astronomers on “Astronomy and data Science” was held on 7-11 September
2020. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year the summer school was held
online. 50 young astronomers and 12 lecturers from 21 countries participated in
7BISS. Moreover, an opportunity was created for the public sector to take part
in the school as listeners.

In the framework of the school, participants had 15 lectures and 11 practical
tutorial sessions on Astronomical Surveys, Digitization of astronomical data,
Astronomical Catalogues, Databases and Archives, Astrostatistics and
Astroinformatics, Big Data in Astronomy and Virtual Observatory tools. Among the
famous lecturers were IAU Vice-President Ajit Kembhavi (India), co-founder of
Astroinformatics Ashish Mahabal (USA), Chair of International Virtual
Observatory Alliance (IVOA) Chenzhou Cui, Fabio Pasian (Italy), Markus
Demleitner (Germany), Oleg Malkov (Russia) and others.

At closing, 3 participants who stood out with their presentations were
nominated. They were Marta Obolentseva from Saint Petersburg State University
(Russia), Maria Babakhanyan Stone from University of Turku (Finland) and Vanesa
Ramírez from Leiden University (The Netherlands). It should be noted, that the
winners were chosen as a result of the votes given by the lecturers and the
participants. The Byurakan Summer School once again proved the importance of

### The Spanish Virtual Observatory Schools

Miriam Cortés

[The Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO)](https://svo.cab.inta-csic.es/) has large
experience organizing VO schools: 25 within the last eleven years at a national
and international level.

During the last months, and in the context of the pandemic situation, we have
made a large effort to make these schools “virtual”. In November and December
2020, three virtual schools were conducted: two of them as extracurricular
courses for MSc students at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and
Universidad Autónoma de Madrid with 15-20 participants each (similar to previous
editions), and a third one in partnership with the Sociedade Astronômica
Brasileira (SAB) as a capaciting building program with around 60 participants.

The platforms employed to carry out these schools were zoom and a Slack
workspace. Also the whole programme was adapted to the constraints imposed by
remote teaching. The experience gained as well as the positive feedback gathered
from the participants have encouraged us to continue with this model aiming at
reaching a broader audience.

### Gaia Early Data Release 3 available through VO applications

The Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) was successfully released on 3 December
2020. Gaia EDR3 contains detailed information on more than 1.8 billion sources,
detected by the Gaia spacecraft. This represents an increase of more than 100
million sources over the previous data release (Gaia DR2), which was made public
in April 2018. Gaia EDR3 also contains colour information for around 1.5 billion
sources, an increase of about 200 million sources over Gaia DR2. As well as
including more sources, the general accuracy and precision of the measurements
has also improved.

Gaia EDR3 data is available from the
[ESA Gaia Archive](https://archives.esac.esa.int/gaia), from the Gaia partner
data centres:
[Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg(CDS)](http://cds.unistra.fr/gaia),
[ASI Space Science Data Center (SSDC)](https://gaia.ssdc.asi.it/),
[Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI)](http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/) and
[Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP)](https://gaia.aip.de/), from VO Tools
such as [Aladin](https://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinDesktop/),
[TOPCAT](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/) and
[VOSA](http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/svo/theory/vosa/), from VO enabled tools
such as [ESASky](https://sky.esa.int/) and from the specifically developed
[Python Astroquery Gaia module](http://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gaia/gaia.html).

The VO-orientation of the Gaia archive and partner archives and services is the
result of many years of involvement of ESA and the Gaia partner data centres in
the IVOA, and of the contributions through the
[Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC)](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac)
of many partners and experts. As shown by Gaia DR2 and EDR3, VO technologies are
now "release proven" (i.e. can accept very large peak loads) and combine
reliability with functionality, making them an attractive option for future
missions and projects.

# Some recent papers about VO-enabled science

### Featured Science Publication

[Active deep learning method for the discovery of objects of interest in large spectroscopic surveys](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...643A.122S/abstract)  
**Škoda, P.; Podsztavek, O.; Tvrdík, P.**  
_A&A (2020) Volume 643, A122_


_Context._ Current archives of the LAMOST telescope contain millions of
pipeline-processed spectra that have probably never been seen by human eyes.
Most of the rare objects with interesting physical properties, however, can only
be identified by visual analysis of their characteristic spectral features. A
proper combination of interactive visualisation with modern machine learning
techniques opens new ways to discover such objects.

_Aims._ We apply active learning classification methods supported by deep
convolutional neural networks to automatically identify complex emission-line
shapes in multi-million spectra archives.

_Methods._ We used the pool-based uncertainty sampling active learning method
driven by a custom-designed deep convolutional neural network with 12 layers.
The architecture of the network was inspired by VGGNet, AlexNet, and ZFNet, but
it was adapted for operating on one-dimensional feature vectors. The unlabelled
pool set is represented by 4.1 million spectra from the LAMOST data release 2
survey. The initial training of the network was performed on a labelled set of
about 13 000 spectra obtained in the 400 Å wide region around Hα by the 2 m
Perek telescope of the Ondřejov observatory, which mostly contains spectra of Be
and related early-type stars. The differences between the Ondřejov
intermediate-resolution and the LAMOST low-resolution spectrographs were
compensated for by Gaussian blurring and wavelength conversion.

_Results._ After several iterations, the network was able to successfully
identify emission-line stars with an error smaller than 6.5%. Using the
technology of the Virtual Observatory to visualise the results, we discovered
1013 spectra of 948 new candidates of emission-line objects in addition to 664
spectra of 549 objects that are listed in SIMBAD and 2644 spectra of 2291
objects identified in an earlier paper of a Chinese group led by Wen Hou. The
most interesting objects with unusual spectral properties are discussed in
detail.
