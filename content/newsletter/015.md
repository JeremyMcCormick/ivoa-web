**IVOA Newsletter Editors:** Mark G. Allen, Deborah Baines, Chenzou Cui, August
Muench & Ivan Zolotukhin.

**The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) was formed in June 2002
with a mission to facilitate the international coordination and collaboration
necessary for the development and deployment of the tools, systems and
organizational structures necessary to enable the international utilization of
astronomical archives as an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory.
The IVOA now comprises 20 VO programs from Argentina, Armenia, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Europe, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy,
Japan, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United
States and an inter-governmental organization (ESA). Membership is open to other
national and international programs according to the
[IVOA Guidelines for Participation](http://ivoa.net/Documents/latest/IVOAParticipation.html).
You can read more about the IVOA and what we do at <http://ivoa.net/about/>.**

### What is the VO?

The Virtual Observatory (VO) aims to provide a research environment that will
open up new possibilities for scientific research based on data discovery,
efficient data access, and interoperability. The vision is of global astronomy
archives connected via the VO to form a multiwavelength digital sky that can be
searched, visualized, and analyzed in new and innovative ways. VO projects
worldwide working toward this vision are already providing science capabilities
with new tools and services. This newsletter, aimed at astronomers, highlights
VO tools and technologies for doing astronomy research, recent papers, and
upcoming events.

### China-VO enabled Popular Supernova Project

On July 29, 2015, the [Popular Supernova Project](http://psp.china-vo.org/) was
launched. It is the first astronomical citizen science project in China as a
joint venture between [China-VO](http://www.china-vo.org/) and
[Xingming Amateur Astronomical Observatory](http://www.xjltp.com/xo/index-en.htm).
In the morning of Sep. 12, a supernova candidate was discovered by a 10-year old
pupil. Inspired by the news, number of the registered users of China-VO platform
raised rapidly to 105K by the end of September. Currently, two supernova
candidates discovered by public users have been confirmed by professional
observations.

The project webpage is prepared in Chinese; an English version is planned for a
proper time in the future.

### ASTERICS Virtual Observatory School

The [ASTERICS](http://asterics2020.eu/) project is organising a VO School at
Centro de Astrobiología, Madrid, Spain. The goal of the school is twofold:
Expose European astronomers and representatives of the
[ESFRI](http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index_en.cfm?pg=esfri)
projects involved in ASTERICS to the variety of VO tools and services available
today so that they can use them efficiently for their own research and gather
requirement and feedback from them.

Important dates:

* Deadline for submission of participants' use cases:
  13 November 2015
* Deadline for registration:
  30 November 2015
* Meeting:
  15-17 December 2015

More information can be found at the school
[website](https://www.astron.nl/asterics/doku.php?id=open:wp4:school1).

### WWT Guided Tour Design Competition

The award ceremony of the 2nd WWT Guided Tour Contest was held on July 28, 2015.
The contest was organized by [China-VO](http://www.china-vo.org/), Microsoft
Research and other partners, began in early 2015, and was designed to promote
the concept of scientific data-based science education and the open sharing of
scientific and technological resources and knowledge. About 100 tours were
submitted by school students and amateur astronomers. Videos of awarded tours
are released to the public at <http://wwt.china-vo.org/tours2015/>.

# VO applications and implementation highlights

{{< side-image image="MMI.png" thumbnail="MMI_small.png" position="right" >}}

### ESA Sky: the ESA Astronomy Multi-Mission Interface

We are pleased to announce the beta v1.0 release of ESA Sky, the ESA Astronomy
Multi-Mission Interface, a science-driven discovery portal for all ESA Astronomy
missions. ESA Sky provides simplified access to high level science-ready data
products from ESA Astronomy missions and a number of ESA produced source
catalogues. No prior knowledge of the involved ESA missions is needed, simply
explore the sky with the sky exploration interface, or conduct single or
multiple target searches. From a technical point of view, the system offers new
all-sky multi-resolution maps of full mission datasets; detailed geometrical
footprints to connect the all-sky mosaics to individual observations; direct
access to the underlying mission-specific science archives; and uses the TAP and
MOC VO protocols. The beta release contains data (imaging only) and catalogues
from the following missions: INTEGRAL, XMM-Newton, HST, Hipparcos, ISO,
Herschel, and Planck.

We are extremely interested in your feedback and would like to hear from you via
our [helpdesk](https://support.cosmos.esa.int/esdc/). You can see a
[video demo](https://youtu.be/e4VUW7WCbKk?t=7m20s) of the ESA Sky beta or try
the [beta interface](http://archives.esac.esa.int/esasky-beta).

Acknowledgement: ESA Sky makes use of the Aladin sky atlas and HiPS
(Hierarchical Progressive Surveys), developed at CDS, Strasbourg Observatory,
France.

### The Keck Observatory Archive

The Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) ([website](https://koa.ipac.caltech.edu/)) has released a program-friendly interface to public images acquired with all nine Keck instruments equipped with an imaging mode. The interface is compliant with the latest VO-image access standard, Simple Image Access Protocol (SIAP_ v2, June, 2015). The interface is fully [documented](https://koa.ipac.caltech.edu/UserGuide/program_interface.html) and includes a detailed description of the input and output parameters, examples for each instrument, a troubleshooting guide and a web-based query builder that allows users to create queries that are later run from a program.

### TAO v2.0: The Theoretical Astrophysical Observatory

The [Theoretical Astrophysical Observatory](https://tao.asvo.org.au/) (TAO)
houses data from popular cosmological N-body simulations and semi-analytic
galaxy formation models, primarily focused on survey science. Mock catalogues
can be built from the database without the need for any coding. Results can be
funnelled through higher-level modules to build custom light-cones and images.
TAO is accessible from anywhere you can access the internet.

TAO v2.0 has just been released with many front and back-end enhancements. These
include the option to download premade mock catalogues (e.g. created in advance
for a specific survey, like CANDELS or SDSS), significant improvements to the
image module to make it easier to image your mock galaxies, and an update of the
SAGE semi-analytic model to its public release version
([Croton et al. 2015](https://github.com/darrencroton/sage)). Head over to TAO
now and build your own universe!

### TOPCAT TAP Improvements

The recent release (v4.3) of the table analysis tool TOPCAT features a major
overhaul of its TAP window. TAP, the Table Access Protocol, lets you run
flexible SQL-like queries on remote astronomical databases. The updated TAP
window is easier to use and more powerful than before: improvements include the
ability to search for datasets by table name or description, better query
editing facilities, more useful information about the service you're using, and
a list of example queries to help you write your own, including examples
specific to the current database. It also now works well with very large TAP
services, including HEASARC from NASA (900 tables) and VizieR from CDS (30,000
tables).

# Some recent papers about VO-enabled science

### Featured Science Publication

[The number fraction of discs around brown dwarfs in Orion OB1a and the 25 Orionis group](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.450.3490D)  
**Downes, Juan José; Román-Zúñiga, Carlos; Ballesteros-Paredes, Javier; Mateu,
Cecilia; Briceño, César; Hernández, Jesús; Petr-Gotzens, Monika G.; Calvet,
Nuria; Hartmann, Lee; Mauco, Karina.**  
_Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 450, 3490-3502 (2015)._

We present a study of 15 new brown dwarfs belonging to the ˜7 Myr old 25 Orionis
group and Orion OB1a subassociation with spectral types between M6 and M9 and
estimated masses between ˜0.07 and ˜0.01 M⊙. By comparing them through a
Bayesian method with low-mass stars (0.8 ≲ M/M⊙ ≲ 0.1) from previous works in
the 25 Orionis group, we found statistically significant differences in the
number fraction of classical T Tauri stars, Weak T Tauri stars, class II,
evolved discs and purely photospheric emitters at both sides of the substellar
mass limit. Particularly, we found a fraction of 3.9^{+2.4}_{-1.6} per cent
low-mass stars classified as Classic T Tauri star and class II or evolved discs,
against a fraction of 33.3^{+10.8}_{-9.8} per cent in the substellar mass
domain. Our results support the suggested scenario in which the dissipation of
discs is less efficient for decreasing mass of the central object.
