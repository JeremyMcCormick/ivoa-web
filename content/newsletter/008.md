**The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) was formed in June 2002
with a mission to facilitate the international coordination and collaboration
necessary for the development and deployment of the tools, systems and
organizational structures necessary to enable the international utilization of
astronomical archives as an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory.
The IVOA now comprises 19 VO programs from Argentina, Armenia, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan,
Russia, Spain, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States and an
inter-governmental organization (ESA). Membership is open to other national and
international programs according to the IVOA Guidelines for Participation. You
can read more about the IVOA and what we do at <http://www.ivoa.net/pub/info/>.**

### What is the VO?

The Virtual Observatory (VO) aims to provide a research environment that will
open up new possibilities for scientific research based on data discovery,
efficient data access, and interoperability. The vision is of global astronomy
archives connected via the VO to form a multiwavelength digital sky that can be
searched, visualized, and analyzed in new and innovative ways. VO projects
worldwide working toward this vision are already providing science capabilities
with new tools and services. This newsletter, aimed at astronomers, highlights
VO tools and technologies for doing astronomy research, recent papers, and
upcoming events.

# IVOA news

> This issue is dedicated to the memory of
> [Dr. Dave De Young](http://www.usvao.org/news/?p=261), one of the pioneers of
> the Virtual Observatory movement.  Dave, who was an astronomer at NOAO from 1980
> until his retirement in September 2011, was Project Scientist of the National
> Virtual Observatory (2002-2009) and of the Virtual Astronomical Observatory
> (2009-2011). He was a a great source of strength and inspiration for the IVOA,
> of which he was the Vice-Chair (2006-2007) and Chair (2007-2008).  Through his
> role as the Chair of the Standing Committee on Science Priorities (2008-2011)
> Dave did much to target VO efforts towards applications to scientific issues,
> rather than just technology development.  Dave's presence will be greatly missed
> at IVOA meetings, during the sessions, as well as in the evenings where he
> dazzled everyone with his knowledge, wisdom and personality.

### US VAO Data Discovery Portal


Find datasets from thousands of astronomical collections known to the VO and
over wide areas of the sky. This includes important collections from archives
around the world. Feedback on your experience with the tool is appreciated --
please send your comments, suggestions, and questions to the
[VAO Help Desk](http://www.usvao.org/contact.php).

**More information:** <http://www.usvao.org/tools>

### VOSA (VO Sed Analyzer) 3.0

VOSA is a tool developed by the Spanish VO to determine physical parameters
(e.g. temperatures, gravities, masses, ages) of astronomical objects through the
comparison of photometry gathered from VO services, with collections of
theoretical models. VOSA 3.0 represents a profound change with respect to
previous versions: new VO services, new theoretical collections, and new
functionalities such as template fitting and estimation of the extinction,
making VOSA a powerful tool in many areas of research astrophysics. VOSA can
also be used as a platform to develop new specific applications for different
astrophysical problems benefiting from a common methodological base (e.g.,
[Sanchez-Janssen 2011IAUS..277..230S](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011IAUS..277..230S)).

### US VAO Cross-Comparison Tool

Perform fast positional cross-matches between an input table of up to 1 million
sources and common astronomical source catalogs, such as 2MASS, SDSS DR7 and
USNO-B. Feedback on your experience with the tool is appreciated -- please send
your comments, suggestions, and questions to the
[VAO Help Desk](http://www.usvao.org/contact.php).

{{< side-image image="voplot_thumb.jpg" >}}

### VOPlot v1.8 Beta

VOPlot v1.8Beta includes many enhancements and bug fixes. To name a few v1.8Beta
supports multi-grid plots for 2D Scatter-Plot which allows the user to have
multiple plots having grid size from 1x1 to 3x3 in a single window. Paginated
view is added to see data in tabular format which allows user to navigate
systematically. Provision to label Lat/Long lines is also added. Users can now
plot a cumulative histogram for all histogram types. VOPlot 1.8Beta shows the
metadata of a FITS file instantaneously while the actual loading happens in
background. VOPlot v1.8Beta also provides better handling of "faulty data" while
parsing an ASCII file.

### CDS XMatch Service

CDS Xmatch is a new service for efficient positional cross-matching of very
large catalogues. Input catalogues include all (~10000) VizieR tables, a tabular
view of the Simbad database, plus GALEX, UKIDSS DR5 LAS, SDSS DR8, and
user-uploaded tables. The service has been designed for large jobs; for example,
the entire SDSS DR8 can be cross-matched with the 2MASS point source catalogue
in less than 17 minutes, resulting in ~55x106 cross-matched associations with
separations <2.5", and producing a ~15GB output file.

### US VAO Time Series Search Tool

Discover time-series data from the Harvard Time Series Center, Catalina
Real-time Transient Survey, and the NASA Exoplanet archive - and analyze them
with the NASA Exoplanet Archive periodogram application. Feedback on your
experience with the tool is appreciated -- please send your comments,
suggestions, and questions to the

# Some recent papers about VO-enabled science

### Featured Paper

[Identification of red high proper-motion objects in Tycho-2 and 2MASS catalogues using Virtual Observatory tools](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1201.5315J)

Jiménez-Esteban, F. M.; Caballero, J. A.; Dorda, R.; Miles-Páez, P. A.; Solano, E.

Astronomy & Astrophysics, Volume 539, id.A86

With available Virtual Observatory tools, we looked for new M dwarfs in the
solar neighbourhood and M giants with high tangential velocities. From an
all-sky cross-match between the optical Tycho-2 and the near-infrared 2MASS
catalogues, we selected objects with proper motions μ > 50 mas yr-1 and very red
VT - Ks colours. For the most interesting targets, we collected multi-wavelength
photometry, constructed spectral energy distributions, estimated effective
temperatures and surface gravities from fits to atmospheric models, performed
time-series analysis of ASAS V-band light curves, and assigned spectral types
from low-resolution spectroscopy obtained with CAFOS at the 2.2 m Calar Alto
telescope. We got a sample of 59 bright red high proper-motion objects,
including fifty red giants, four red dwarfs, and five objects reported in this
work for the first time. The five new stars have magnitudes VT ≈ 10.8-11.3 mag,
reduced proper motions midway between known dwarfs and giants, near-infrared
colours typical of giants, and effective temperatures Teff ≈ 2900-3400 K. From
our time-series analysis, we discovered a long secondary period in Ruber 4 and
an extremely long primary period in Ruber 6. With the CAFOS spectra, we
confirmed the red giant nature of Ruber 7 and 8, the last of which seems to be
one of the brightest metal-poor M giants ever identified.
