**The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) was formed in June 2002
with a mission to facilitate the international coordination and collaboration
necessary for the development and deployment of the tools, systems and
organizational structures necessary to enable the international utilization of
astronomical archives as an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory.
The IVOA now comprises 19 VO programs from Argentina, Armenia, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan,
Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States and inter-governmental
organizations (ESA and ESO). Membership is open to other national and
international programs according to the IVOA Guidelines for Participation. You
can read more about the IVOA and what we do at <http://www.ivoa.net/pub/info/>.**

### What is the VO?

The Virtual Observatory (VO) aims to provide a research environment that will
open up new possibilities for scientific research based on data discovery,
efficient data access, and interoperability. The vision is of global astronomy
archives connected via the VO to form a multiwavelength digital sky that can be
searched, visualized, and analyzed in new and innovative ways. VO projects
worldwide working toward this vision are already providing science capabilities
with new tools and services. This newsletter, aimed at astronomers, highlights
VO tools and technologies for doing astronomy research, recent papers, and
upcoming events.

### Argentina joins the IVOA

In February 2011, The IVOA Executive Committee approved Argentina's application
to join the IVOA. With the addition of the
[Nuevo Observatory Virtual Argentino (NOVA)](http://nova.org.ar/), the total
number of IVOA member organizations worldwide has now reached 19, covering four
continents and many time zones. Argentina's membership, which follows that of
Brazil in September 2009, demonstrates the growing interest in VO in South
America. Informal expressions of interest have also been received recently by
other countries in South America, Europe, and Africa. More information on IVOA
Members and Membership can be found on the [IVOA Members](/members/) page and
the document describing
[Guidelines for Participation](http://ivoa.net/Documents/latest/IVOAParticipation.html).

### VODance

VODance is a tool for rapid deployment of Virtual Observatory compliant services. This tool helps users to publish their datasets to the Virtual Observatory without dealing with the technical details, and without having to move their data. Publishing is as easy as configuring a database connection to INAF IA2 (Italian Astronomical Archive Center) pointing to the data, and providing a standardized metadata description. Virtual Observatory services are then created, providing access to the data. VODance has been successfully used to publish image and tabular data from MySQL and Oracle database management systems.

### TOPCAT talks TAP

TOPCAT is a powerful and easy-to-use GUI table analysis tool offering plotting,
matching, selection, and many other facilities for exploration of large or small
catalogues. It has extensive capabilities for accessing remote data -- from
direct access to special purpose services such as VizieR and the Millennium
Simulation to positional searches and positional crossmatching with remote
catalogue, image and spectral data sets -- all powered by the VO-enabled
services which many astronomical archives offer. The latest version, 3.8, adds
support for the recently standardized Table Access Protocol (TAP) which allows
SQL-like queries from a uniform interface to remote surveys and other databases,
opening the door to much more flexible data mining than position-based
selections, bringing the power of SQL-based queries  to many more data sets.

### EURO-VO scientific tutorials

In the past three years, as a result of the three VO Schools organised by the
EURO-VO, a number of science tutorials using VO tools and services have been
made available online. These science cases include examples from both galactic
and extragalactic astronomy and explore VO capabilities such as accessing
images, spectra and catalogues of individual objects or lists of objects
simultaneously, cross-correlating large catalogues, combining images coming from
different observatories/instruments/wavelengths, analysing spectral lines, and
more. The tutorials are being kept up-to-date to reflect the latest versions of
the various tools.

# Some recent papers about VO-enabled science

### Featured Paper

[A search for new hot subdwarf stars by means of Virtual Observatory tools](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...530A...2O)

Oreiro et al., 2011, A&A, 530, A2

Hot subdwarf stars are faint, blue objects whose origin is still uncertain.
Increasing the number of detections is crucial to undertake statistical studies
that could shed light on this question. This work describes a strategy to find
new, uncatalogued hot subdwarfs making use of Virtual Observatory tools. More
precisely, VO applications were used to collect photometry from very large
surveys, namely GALEX and 2MASS, in order to select adequate subdwarf
candidates, to build and fit the spectral energy distribution of these
candidates and estimate their effective temperature, Teff, before heading to the
telescope for spectroscopic confirmation. The high success rate (the
contamination factor is of only 13%) demonstrates the validity of the
methodology and its application to the entire sky will be presented in a
forthcoming work.
