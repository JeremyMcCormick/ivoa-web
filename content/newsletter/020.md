**The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) was formed in June 2002
with a mission to facilitate the international coordination and collaboration
necessary for the development and deployment of the tools, systems and
organizational structures necessary to enable the international utilization of
astronomical archives as an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory.
The IVOA now comprises 20 VO programs from Argentina, Armenia, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Europe, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy,
Japan, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United
States and an inter-governmental organization (ESA). Membership is open to other
national and international programs according to the
[IVOA Guidelines for Participation](http://ivoa.net/Documents/latest/IVOAParticipation.html).
You can read more about the IVOA and what we do at <http://ivoa.net/about/>.**

### What is the VO?

The Virtual Observatory (VO) aims to provide a research environment that will
open up new possibilities for scientific research based on data discovery,
efficient data access, and interoperability. The vision is of global astronomy
archives connected via the VO to form a multiwavelength digital sky that can be
searched, visualized, and analyzed in new and innovative ways. VO projects
worldwide working toward this vision are already providing science capabilities
with new tools and services. This newsletter, aimed at astronomers, highlights
VO tools and technologies for doing astronomy research, recent papers, and
upcoming events.

### College Park IVOA Interoperability Meeting

The Northern Fall IVOA Interoperability Meeting was held on November 8-10, 2018
in College Park, Maryland, USA, supported by the NASA Astronomical Virtual
Observatories (NAVO) and the US Virtual Observatory Alliance (USVOA). There were
109 registered participants who gathered for two and a half days of productive
discussions.

The Working Group and Interest Group sessions covered scientific and
technological aspects of interoperability of astronomy data and services. Many
presentations reported on practical implementations of IVOA standards, showing
results and providing feedback. Progress was reported on the ‘Time Domain’
priority area. A number of contributions focussed on emerging needs of the
astronomy community such as standards to support multi-messenger astronomy, and
improving the access to VO resources via python language tools. Other topics
included the status of operations in ‘VO weather reports’ and the use of Digital
Object Identifiers (DOIs) for data and queries.

As usual for ‘IVOA Interops’ held at this time of year, the meeting was
connected to the ADASS conference. For a change, and partly due to a local
football match, this Interop was held before ADASS. VO topics were prominent at
ADASS, including two hands-on tutorials on the use of VO technologies (see under
"Schools and Workshops"), an invited talk on Time Domain Astronomy by the IVOA
Time Domain Interest Group chair, a talk on ‘Astropy and the VO’ and various
demonstration booths highlighting VO access to data.

Warm thanks to the local organisers lead by NAVO and USVOA! Mark your calendars
for the next IVOA Interoperability Meeting in Paris, France, May 12-17, 2019.

# Schools and Workshops

{{< side-image image="voschool.png" thumbnail="voschool_s.png" position="right" floating="true" >}}

### Fourth ASTERICS Virtual Observatory School

The [ASTERICS](http://asterics2020.eu/) project held its fourth VO school at the
Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS) in Strasbourg on 20-22
November 2018. The goal of the school was twofold: (1) to expose European
astronomers and representatives of the
[ESFRI](http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index_en.cfm?page=esfri)
projects involved in ASTERICS to the variety of VO tools and services available
today so that they can use them efficiently for their own research, and (2) to
gather requirements and feedback from participants.

During the first two days, VO experts gave hands-on sessions on the usage of VO
tools and services using real life examples of scientific applications, which
allowed participants to become fully familiar with the VO capabilities on their
own laptops. The last day was then dedicated to the participants own science
cases, applying what they had learnt earlier in the week.

### Tutorials during ADASS 2018

Two VO-related tutorials were given on Sunday, 11 November 2018 during the last
ADASS meeting in College Park, USA. During each of the 2 hours session,
participants familiarized themselves with different VO standards and tools.

In [Tutorial T1, "All-sky astronomy with HiPS and MOCs"](http://cds.unistra.fr/adass2018/)
conducted by Sebastien Derriere, the goal was to create image and catalogue
HiPS, learn how to compare them to reference datasets, and share them in a web
page. Advanced usage with the Table Access Protocol and the Astropy/MOCPy
libraries was also shown.

In [Tutorial T3, "A comprehensive use case scenario of VO standards and protocols"](http://www.g-vo.org/pmwiki/VOWorkshop/VOtutorialADASS2018)
conducted by Hendrik Heinl, participants were introduced to the usage of some VO
standards and how one can remotely crossmatch between different services and
surveys. This was applied to identifying brown dwarves in 2MASS and SDSS.

# Some recent papers about VO-enabled science

### Featured Science Publication

[Three Hypervelocity White Dwarfs in Gaia DR2: Evidence for Dynamically Driven Double-degenerate Double-detonation Type Ia Supernovae](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018ApJ...865...15S/abstract)  
**Shen, Ken J.; Boubert, Douglas; Gänsicke, Boris T.; Jha, Saurabh W.; Andrews, Jennifer E.; Chomiuk, Laura; Foley, Ryan J.; Fraser, Morgan; Gromadzki, Mariusz; Guillochon, James; Kotze, Marissa M.; Maguire, Kate; Siebert, Matthew R.; Smith, Nathan; Strader, Jay; Badenes, Carles; Kerzendorf, Wolfgang E.; Koester, Detlev; Kromer, Markus; Miles, Broxton Pakmor, Rüdiger; Schwab, Josiah; Toloza, Odette; Toonen, Silvia; Townsley, Dean M.; Williams, Brian J.**  
_ApJ (2018) Volume 609, A10_

Double detonations in double white dwarf (WD) binaries undergoing unstable mass
transfer have emerged in recent years as one of the most promising Type Ia
supernova (SN Ia) progenitor scenarios. One potential outcome of this
“dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation” (D6) scenario is that
the companion WD survives the explosion and is flung away with a velocity equal
to its >1000 km s−1 pre-SN orbital velocity. We perform a search for these
hypervelocity runaway WDs using Gaia's second data release. In this paper, we
discuss seven candidates followed up with ground-based instruments. Three
sources are likely to be some of the fastest known stars in the Milky Way, with
total Galactocentric velocities between 1000 and 3000 km s−1, and are consistent
with having previously been companion WDs in pre-SN Ia systems. However,
although the radial velocity of one of the stars is >1000 km s−1, the radial
velocities of the other two stars are puzzlingly consistent with 0. The combined
five-parameter astrometric solutions from Gaia and radial velocities from
follow-up spectra yield tentative 6D confirmation of the D6 scenario. The past
position of one of these stars places it within a faint, old SN remnant, further
strengthening the interpretation of these candidates as hypervelocity runaways
from binary systems that underwent SNe Ia.
