**The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) was formed in June 2002
with a mission to facilitate the international coordination and collaboration
necessary for the development and deployment of the tools, systems and
organizational structures necessary to enable the international utilization of
astronomical archives as an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory.
The IVOA now comprises 20 VO programs from Argentina, Armenia, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Europe, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy,
Japan, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United
States and an inter-governmental organization (ESA). Membership is open to other
national and international programs according to the
[IVOA Guidelines for Participation](http://ivoa.net/Documents/latest/IVOAParticipation.html).
You can read more about the IVOA and what we do at <http://ivoa.net/about/>.**

### What is the VO?

The Virtual Observatory (VO) aims to provide a research environment that will
open up new possibilities for scientific research based on data discovery,
efficient data access, and interoperability. The vision is of global astronomy
archives connected via the VO to form a multiwavelength digital sky that can be
searched, visualized, and analyzed in new and innovative ways. VO projects
worldwide working toward this vision are already providing science capabilities
with new tools and services. This newsletter, aimed at astronomers, highlights
VO tools and technologies for doing astronomy research, recent papers, and
upcoming events.

# IVOA news

## Gaia in the VO

The 14th September 2016 saw the release of the long awaited Gaia Data Release 1
(DR1), which includes positions and G magnitudes for over 1 billion sources, the
five-parameter astrometric solution for over 2 million sources (Tycho-Gaia
Astrometric Solution, TGAS), photometric data of selected RR Lyrae and Cepheid
variable stars, positions and G magnitudes for over 2000 quasars, and
cross-matches between Gaia sources and many other catalogues (see
[here](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr1) for the full list of contents).
Many of the IVOA member organisations and individual members have played an
important role in the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium
([DPAC](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium)), and as such, a
host of data centres and institutes are now providing the Gaia DR1 data using VO
protocols. These data centres and institutes include ESA's
[ESAC Science Data Centre (ESDC)](http://archives.esac.esa.int/),
[Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS)](http://cds.unistra.fr/gaia),
[Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI)](http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/),
[Leibniz-Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP)](https://gaia.aip.de/) and the
[ASI Science Data Center (ASDC)](http://gaiaportal.asdc.asi.it/). Other
institutes around the world are also hosting the Gaia DR1 data, these include
the [Japanese Virtual Observatory](http://jvo.nao.ac.jp/portal/gaia.do),
[NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive](http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/Gator/nph-scan?projshort=Gaia)
and the [German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO)](http://dc.zah.uni-heidelberg.de/__system__/dc_tables/list/form).
Additionally, new functionalities to access and analyse Gaia data have been
implemented in a number of VO Tools, including
[Aladin Desktop](http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinDesktop/),
[TOPCAT](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/) and
[VOSA](http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/theory/vosa/). Within this newsletter, we
highlight some of the data centres and VO tools providing access to Gaia data
using VO protocols.

### Gaia DR1 at ESA

The [ESA Gaia Archive](http://archives.esac.esa.int/gaia) was released to the
public on the 14th September 2016 with
[Gaia DR1](http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr1). As the official repository
for Gaia data, it has been validated by the DPAC consortium and provides access
to all of the DR1 data. Being a VO inside archive based in TAP, its services are
fully interoperable and available from VO tools (eg. Topcat). Its back-end
infrastructure allows users to perform SQL analytics over billion scale
catalogues. While keeping compatibility with TAP 1.0, the protocol has been
extended to TAP+, providing authentication, stateful uploads, server side
crossmatches and other functionalities, allowing data analysis to move closer to
the data.

Gaia DR1 catalogues are also available via [ESASky](http://sky.esa.int/), a
science driven discovery portal for space-based astronomy missions.

The ESA Gaia Archive can be accessed at: <http://archives.esac.esa.int/gaia>
and ESASky at: <http://sky.esa.int>

### Gaia DR1 at CDS

Gaia DR1 data are available since September 14th in CDS services: VizieR, Aladin
and the CDS cross-matching service. In addition to the regular
[VizieR interface](http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=I/337), VO
access is provided through cone search queries and through TAP allowing the user
to formulate SQL-like queries from our
[web interface](http://tapvizier.u-strasbg.fr/adql/?I/337) or from any TAP
client (Topcat or TAPHandle for instance). Aladin Desktop features a dedicated
form for easy access to Gaia data and visualization of proper motions. The
cross-match service offers fast spatial cross-identifications of Gaia data with
VizieR 16,000+ tables with positions or user-uploaded tables. Access to the
cross-match is done either via our
[web page](http://cdsxmatch.u-strasbg.fr/) or via Topcat. Gaia DR1 has also been
made available as HiPS progressive catalogues, seamlessly browsable from Aladin
Desktop and Aladin Lite as demonstrated
[here](http://cds.unistra.fr/Gaia/DR1/AL-visualisation.gml).

### Gaia DR1 at ARI

The Astronomisches Rechen Institut (ARI) in Heidelberg (Germany) is one of the
few institutes officially publishing the Gaia data. It is providing access to
the Gaia catalogue through three services:

* **Single Source Search:** it is a simple service returning the closest Gaia
  (or TGAS) source from a given position, object name (resolved by Simbad) or
  Gaia source ID. It is not a VO service and is then accessible only on the web
  page or by HTTP requests using tools like wget or curl.
* **Cone Search:** it is following the IVOA standard SCS. There is one entry for
  Gaia and another one for TGAS. Both are registered in the VO Registry and are
  then easily accessible through VO clients like TOPCAT.
* **TAP:** eight Gaia DR1 tables and some famous catalogues can be queried here
  using the freedom of ADQL. This service is also listed in the VO Registry.

A nice feature for data discovery has been added to this TAP service: metadata
describing the numerical columns with simple summary statistics (e.g. mean,
quartiles, min, max). These additional pieces of information are visible in
TOPCAT (versions >= 4.3-4). Besides, histograms and sky maps for the same
catalogue columns can also be seen and downloaded through the web site. These
sky-maps show the average value of the represented catalogue column on the whole
sky using Healpix maps (which can be downloaded and displayed in Aladin for more
interactivity). Of course a density map for almost all published tables is also
available.

## Aliyun becomes strategic partner of the China-VO


{{< side-image image="China-VO.png" thumbnail="China-VO.png" position="right" >}}

On 13 October, Yan Jun (Director of National Astronomical Observatory of China,
NAOC) and Hu Xiaoming (President of Aliyun Cloud Computing Co., Ltd.) announced
the news in the [2016 Computing Conference](https://yunqi.aliyun.com/), held in
Hangzhou, that Aliyun has become a strategic partner of the China-VO. Aliyun is
the largest public Cloud computing service provider in China, and third largest
in the world.

Big data not only provides broad prospects for astronomy discoveries and
innovation, but also brings many technical challenges, which covers the whole
life cycle of data, including collection, transmission, storage, process,
analysis and open access. As strategic partners, NAOC and Aliyun are planning to
establish “NAOC-Aliyun Astronomical Big Data Joint Research Center”. The Chinese
Virtual Observatory (China-VO) will be migrated into the Aliyun platform to
enhance its capability as a full lifecycle data management and open access
environment.

## Virtual Observatory India News

{{< side-image image="VO-I.png" thumbnail="VO-I.png" position="left" >}}

[Virtual Observatory India (VO-I)](http://voi.iucaa.in/voi/) and the Data
Intensive Science projects based at IUCAA together organise a number of
workshops on Astronomy with the VO every year. Two such workshops during 2016
have been "Astronomy With Small telescopes and the Virtual Observatory" at
IUCAA, and "Big Data in Astronomy" at BITS-Pilani in Hyderabad, which is a major
engineering and technology institute. VO basics and Data Analysis are discussed
in these workshops, along with hands-on VO sessions, which have exercises like
Motion of Bernard's Star and the Fundamental Plane of Galaxies.

# Schools and Workshops

{{< side-image image="asterics_school.jpg" thumbnail="Asterics_small.jpg" position="right" >}}

### Second ASTERICS Virtual Observatory School

The [ASTERICS](http://asterics2020.eu/) project held its second VO school at the
Observatoire Astronomique de Strasbourg, France, on 15-17 November 2016. The
goal of the school was twofold: to expose European astronomers and
representatives of the
[ESFRI](http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index_en.cfm?pg=esfri)
projects involved in ASTERICS to the variety of VO tools and services available
today so that they can use them efficiently for their own research; and to
gather requirements and feedback from participants.

During the first two days, VO experts gave hands-on sessions on the usage of VO
tools and services using real life examples of scientific applications. A large
fraction of the time was dedicated to hands-on exercises using real life
examples of scientific applications, which allowed participants to become fully
familiar with the VO capabilities on their own laptops. The last day was then
dedicated to the participants own science cases, applying what they had learnt
earlier in the week.

More information can be found
[here](https://www.asterics2020.eu/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=open:wp4:school2),
including the [hands-on
tutorials](https://www.asterics2020.eu/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=open:wp4:school2:program).

### Gaia Data Access Workshop in Heidelberg

From 21st to 24th November 2016 the Gaia Data Access Workshop took place at the
"Haus der Astronomie" in Heidelberg. Organised by the GAVO and Gaia groups at
ARI/ZAH and in collaboration with CDS and AIP, the 57 participants learned about
the contents of Gaia DR1 and about warnings and caveats using them. In hands-on
tutorial sessions the particpants learned how to use TAP and ADQL to access the
Gaia data via TOPCAT. The Gaia data centres at ARI, CDS, AIP and ESAC presented
the different features of their services and how to use them for using the Gaia
data.

Overall the (secret) aim of using Gaia as an opportunity for VO outreach was a
success.

# VO applications and implementation highlights

{{< side-image image="apogeo-screenshot.jpg" thumbnail="apogeo-screenshot.jpg" position="right" >}}

### APOGEO (Automatic POrtal GEneratOr)

APOGEO (Automatic POrtal GEneratOr) is a tool under development at IA2 that
automatizes the creation of web interfaces for querying astronomical archives,
after an administrator performs a proper configuration process guided by a
graphical wizard. It is possible to select which tables to use for queries,
design the search form interface and customize the layout. The output of the
generation is a package that can be deployed in an application server. The
generated portal is able to query the astronomical archive, manage users login,
retrieve astronomical images consistently with configured data access policies
and send tabular data (VOTables) and files to external applications using the
SAMP VO standard.

**More information:** <http://www.ia2.inaf.it/index.php/13-software/35-apogeo.>

{{< side-image image="Cassis.png" thumbnail="Cassis.png" position="left" >}}

### CASSIS New Release

The CASSIS Team will release a new version (4.0) of the free spectral tool in
November 2016. CASSIS (Centre d'Analyse Scientifique de Spectres Instrumentaux
et Synthétiques) is a Java tool designed to visualize, treat and analyze
observational and synthetic spectra. It uses several pieces of information to
allow the user to perform these tasks: atomic and molecular spectroscopic
databases, radiative transfer models and access to other synthetic and
observational spectra through SAMP, SSA and user files.

In this new version, we have upgraded the tool to use the EPN-TAP protocol to
access spectra from the services of the solar and planetary community. To do
that, we use an independent java library tool developed in collaboration between
the CDPP (Centre de Données de la Physique des Plasmas) and CASSIS, as part of
the Europlanet H2020 project.

Furthermore, we have improved the access to the VAMDC service (Virtual and
Molecular Data Center). Users can now access up to 12 services containing
thousands of species and hundreds of millions of transitions.

### Gaia Photometric Science Alerts at Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge (UK)

Gaia is a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite mission, with the aim of
creating a three-dimensional map of our Galaxy. In the process of measuring the
positions, distances and motions of about a billion stars in the Milky Way Gaia
will also observe thousands of transient events. The
[Gaia Alerts project](https://gaia.ac.uk/) is working to find these events in
the Gaia data, and to announce them to the world in real time.

The Gaia alerts team has been publishing these discoveries in
[various formats](http://gsaweb.ast.cam.ac.uk/alerts/tools) to enable follow-up,
including a dedicated web page for every alert. Beginning on 1st November, Gaia
alerts will also be broadcast as VOEvents at this
[stream](http://voeventdb.4pisky.org/apiv1/list/ivorn?order=-id&ivorn_contains=gaia)
of [4 PI SKY project](https://4pisky.org/voevents/).

If you have any questions please [contact us](mailto:http://gsaweb.ast.cam.ac.uk/alerts/contact).

### Iris 3.0 beta Release

We are happy to announce the release of Iris 3.0 beta. Iris has undergone a
round of plastic surgery, with a full overhaul on the Visualizer, Metadata
Browser, and Fitting Tool. The Visualizer now uses the STILTS plotting API as
its plotting backend. Iris internals, in particular the new Metadata Browser and
the Visualizer, are now heavily based on STIL -- the library both TOPCAT and
STILTS use.

Other new features include high-resolution spectra plotting capabilities,
improved layouts to the Fitting Tool and SED Stacker (a tool for statistically
combining SEDs), and a dedicated client for the VizieR photometry service in
Strasbourg.

For the full list of new features and download instructions, please refer to the
release notes at <http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/iris/v2.1/3.0b1-release.html>.

### VOSA New Release

The Spanish VO released a new version of VOSA in October 2016. VOSA (VO Sed
Analyzer) is a web-based tool designed to build observational spectral energy
distributions and to estimate physical parameters (Teff, logg, [M/H], masses,
ages, etc) from comparison with models.

New photometric catalogues and collections of theoretical models, determination
of stellar radius and masses from the SED fitting, new treatment for upper
limits, footprint visualization of extinction maps using Multi-Object Coverage
(MOC), more efficient management of the fitting results and more detailed
statistical information on the physical parameters obtained from the fit are
some of the functionalities implemented in this new version.

Special attention deserves the upgrades made to deal with Gaia DR1 data.
Photometric information (G magnitudes) as well as parallaxes from TGAS can now
be used in the VOSA workflow.

# Some recent papers about VO-enabled science

### Featured Science Publication

[Search for associations containing young stars (SACY). VII. New stellar and substellar candidate members in the young associations](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...590A..13E)  
**Elliott, P.; Bayo, A.; Melo, C. H. F.; Torres, C. A. O.; Sterzik, M. F.; Quast, G. R.; Montes, D.; Brahm, R.**  
_Astronomy & Astrophysics (2016) Vol. 590, A13, 28 pp._


Context. The young associations offer us one of the best opportunities to study
the properties of young stellar and substellar objects and to directly image
planets thanks to their proximity (<200 pc) and age (≈5-150 Myr). However, many
previous works have been limited to identifying the brighter, more active
members (≈1 M⊙) owing to photometric survey sensitivities limiting the
detections of lower mass objects.

Aims: We search the field of view of 542 previously identified members of the
young associations to identify wide or extremely wide (1000-100 000 au in
physical separation) companions. Methods: We combined 2MASS near-infrared
photometry (J, H, K) with proper motion values (from UCAC4, PPMXL, NOMAD) to
identify companions in the field of view of known members. We collated further
photometry and spectroscopy from the literature and conducted our own
high-resolution spectroscopic observations for a subsample of candidate members.
This complementary information allowed us to assess the efficiency of our
method.

Results: We identified 84 targets (45: 0.2-1.3 M⊙, 17: 0.08-0.2 M⊙, 22: <0.08
M⊙) in our analysis, ten of which have been identified from spectroscopic
analysis in previous young association works. For 33 of these 84, we were able
to further assess their membership using a variety of properties (X-ray
emission, UV excess, Hα, lithium and K I equivalent widths, radial velocities,
and CaH indices). We derive a success rate of 76-88% for this technique based on
the consistency of these properties.

Conclusions: Once confirmed, the targets identified in this work would
significantly improve our knowledge of the lower mass end of the young
associations. Additionally, these targets would make an ideal new sample for the
identification and study of planets around nearby young stars. Given the
predicted substellar mass of the majority of these new candidate members and
their proximity, high-contrast imaging techniques would facilitate the search
for new low-mass planets.
