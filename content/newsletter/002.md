### What is the VO?

The Virtual Observatory (VO) aims to provide a research environment that will
open up new possibilities for scientific research based on data discovery,
efficient data access, and interoperability. The vision is of global astronomy
archives connected via the VO to form a multiwavelength digital sky that can be
searched, visualized, and analyzed in new and innovative ways. VO projects
worldwide working toward this vision are already providing science capabilities
with new tools and services. This newsletter, aimed at astronomers, highlights
VO tools and technologies for doing astronomy research, recent papers, and
upcoming events

### What is the IVOA?

The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) was formed in June 2002
with a mission to "facilitate the international coordination and collaboration
necessary for the development and deployment of the tools, systems, and
organizational structures necessary to enable the international utilization of
astronomical archives as an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory."
The IVOA now comprises 17 VO projects from Armenia, Australia, Canada, China,
Europe, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Spain, the
United Kingdom, the United States, with Brazil "Observatorio Virtual Basileiro"
joining in April 2009. Membership is open to other national and international
projects according to the IVOA Guidelines for Participation. You can read more
about the IVOA and what we do at <http://www.ivoa.net/pub/info/>.

# VO applications highlights

### US-VO Data Discovery Website

{{< side-image image="usvo_newwebsite.jpg" >}}

The US National Virtual Observatory web page has been redesigned and has new
links to a number of astronomer-friendly tools for data discovery and
exploration. The new home page has a simplified design and a set of icons that
we hope will help users identify frequently used tools and understand how the
tools can be used together. There is a link to the NVO book, which is based on
the NVO Summer Schools and gives extensive background on VO services and how to
use them. Improved on-line help facilities with numerous examples and science
use cases are also available. A new Discovery Wizard can help you determine
which tools are most useful for your particular research needs.

### VisIVO Server: Huge Data Exploration

{{< side-image image="simVisiVO.jpg" thumbnail="simVisiVO_thumb.jpg" >}}

VisIVO is a suite of tools specifically designed for the Virtual Observatory
environment. VisIVO is made of three main tools: VisiVO Desktop, a standalone
application for interactive data exploration, VisIVO Server, and VisIVO Web, a
web portal for data manipulation using VisIVO Server. VisIVO Server is a
command-line application for intuitive data exploration with 3D views being
created from data tables. Its defining characteristic is support for very large
data sizes with no fixed limit on dimensions. A grid version was recently
deployed in the Cometa Consortium computational grid.

### VOPlatform

{{< side-image image="VOPlatform-1.png" thumbnail="VOPlatform_thumb.png" >}}

VOPlatform is a tool that provides users with an environment in which to place
their frequently used VO tools and datasets, along with other resources such as
documents, web links etc. The application has been developed in Java, and acts
on data available in the VO Standard VOTable format. To launch a tool from
within VOPlatform, it must be PLASTIC or SAMP compatible. VOPlatform supports
drag-and-drop functionality and personalized bookmarks.

### TOPCAT: Does what you want with tables

{{< side-image image="topcat.gif" thumbnail="topcat_thumb.gif" >}}

TOPCAT is an easy to use but powerful GUI tool for all kinds of analysis and
manipulation of tabular data, especially source catalogues. It has very flexible
capabilities for plotting, calculation, selection, and crossmatching, amongst
other things. It can read and write data in VO-standard formats (VOTable) as
well as old favourites such as FITS and CSV. TOPCAT provides access to remote
services and other desktop applications using VO standard protocols as well as
being suitable for standalone use on local data. Operations are fast, and tables
with few or many columns - up to around a million rows - are easily handled. A
pure Java implementation makes it easy to install and robust to run. The
companion package STILTS provides command-line access to the same facilities.
TOPCAT is currently developed within the UK's AstroGrid project.

### JVO On-Line Mosaicing Service for the SUBARU SuprimeCAM Images

{{< side-image image="jvo.png" thumbnail="jvo_thumb.png" >}}

The SUBARU telescope is located in Mauna Kea, Hawaii, and is operated by the
National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ). The SuprimeCAM is a
wide-field (~ 30’ x 30’) optical camera, and about 10 TBytes of raw image data
has already been archived. The Japanese Virtual Observatory (JVO) opened access
to the SUBARU SuprimeCAM Images archive in March 2008. JVO also provides an
on-line data reduction (flat, bias, distortion correction, astrometry) and
mosaicing service for the SuprimeCAM images. It is recommended to obtain an
account with the service, but guest users may enjoy the services.

**More information:** <http://jvo.nao.ac.jp/portal/>

### VOSpec version 5.0

{{< side-image image="VOSpecV5.0.jpg" thumbnail="VOSpecV5.0_thumb.jpg" >}}

VOSpec is a multi-wavelength spectral analysis tool with access to spectra,
theoretical models, and atomic and molecular line databases registered in the
VO. The standard tools of VOSpec include line and continuum fitting, redshift
and reddening correction, spectral arithmetic, and convolution between spectra
and equivalent width calculations. The newly released version 5.0 improves the
spectra handling capabilities, offering tree and table display modes, and offers
organising functionalities according to the available metadata, including
distance from the observation position. This version also updates the registry
interface using the new Euro-VO registry and includes the functionality of
adding a local registry. Finally, a new e-support portal is available where
users can submit tickets and receive technical support from the ESA-VO Team.

# Some recent papers about VO-enabled science

### Featured Paper

[The construction of the large quasar astrometric catalogue (LQAC)](http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2009A&A...494..799S),
Souchay J. et al., 2009, A&A, 494, 799.

_Describes use of VO input data catalogues and manipulation tools to construct
the Large Quasar Astrometric Catalogue._

The very large and increasing number of quasars reckoned from various sky
surveys leads to a large quantity of data which brings various and inhomogeneous
information in the fields of astrometry, photometry, radioastronomy and
spectroscopy. In this paper, we describe our work that aims to make available a
general compilation of the largest number of recorded quasars obtained from all
the available catalogues, with their best position estimates, and providing
physical information at both optical and radio wavelengths.
